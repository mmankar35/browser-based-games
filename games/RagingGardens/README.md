HTML5/Javascript web browser game. Entry and an [Honorable Mention](https://github.com/blog/1337-github-game-off-winners) to GitHub [game-off-2012](https://github.com/github/game-off-2012) challenge.

It's a lovely day at farmers field. A great time for a hungry (ninja) rabbit to sneak in and **pull** some carrots to eat.
Too bad you weren't the only one with that idea. A horde of hungry opponents approaches fast! Pull as many carrots
as you can in **3 minutes**. To fight your opponents, you must use ancient *rabbitjutsu* tactics. These are slightly unorthodox.
Simply uhm ... fart to **push** your opponents away or use a **Carrot-on-a-Fork** totem decoy to deceive them.

# Controls
Collect as many carrots as possible in **3 minutes**. Use the controls to move and repel opponents.

  * **Arrow keys** - Move your ninja rabbit on the map.
  * **Z (or Y)** - Hold down to pull a carrot from the ground. You need to be close to a carrot.
  * **Q** - Eat **1 carrot** to fart to push nearby opponents away from you. 
  * **W** - Eat **2 carrots** to spawn a "Carrot-on-a-Fork" totem that attracts opponents and gives you time to pull more carrots elsewhere on the map. The totem is spawned on your current position.
