SORADES 13K
===========

A scrolling shooter in the vein of "Raptor: Call of the Shadows" and
"Warning Forever". Are you able to survive 13 waves? Press X to fire,
F for fullscreen, P for pause, M to switch to the original ship model from
[our full-featured "Starship Sorades" game](http://www.gramambo.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17%3Astarship-sorades&catid=2&Itemid=5)
(yes, I had 3 KB left and wasted them for an easter egg).
Multiple control schemes provided, e.g. cursor keys, WASD and numpad.

I use a lot of pre-rendering and other tricks to make this run as fast as
possible on a wide variety of browsers and machines. Developed with Opera.
Tested with Firefox, Chrome and even Internet Explorer 9 (no sound though).
Fullscreen works in Opera 12.50+, Firefox and WebKit based browsers.
